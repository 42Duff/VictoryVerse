## Future Improvements
- Improve UI (specifically leaderboards page and update designs overall)
- Improve UX for leaderboards page. Try to speed up loading times.
- Add an event that changes the welcome page when a user logs in. Currently when they go back to this page it's just blank.
- Find a workaround for the news page. Currently when scraping news from IGN, the links on the news page bring up different articles in a scroll area instead of opening new pages. Also improve on the UI by having news articles presented differently.
 There is also currently an error where the link is a subtitle of the article and not the main title/header.
- Add an upload/download feature for the mods page. Add a method of preventing suspicious files from being uploaded.
- Improve UI for users page. Also add a social section where users can add friends, post status updates, reply to other users threads, upload highlights, short clips, videos, etc.
- Add a 'Clans' section where users can create/join clans and compete against others.
- Hypothetically would like to look into adding a player stats tracker, although this may involve logging into console platform accounts which is not accessible.
